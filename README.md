# nested_env_manager_2
the second iteration of my first python module with new features, an overall improvement but the old one still exists for what it's worth.

created and uploaded the sequel to the first version of this, for updates of this sequel version please still post them as issues in the github repository of the first version which can be found here: https://github.com/NiaSchim/nested_env_manager

please refer to that repository's readme, for additional information on how I'd like our community to behave and help eachother.

the first one although now functionally obsolete can still serve as a social hub for improvement and tweaks.
